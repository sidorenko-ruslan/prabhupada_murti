    header: "FAQ"
    first_question: "Who can worship the murti?"
    first_question_description: "There are no requirements from our side, and we do not set any standards of worship for you personally, as this is not within our authority. You may consult on this topic with your Spiritual teacher or mentor."
    second_question: "Can I perform an abhisheka for this murti?"
    second_question_description: "Abhisheka can be performed, but it is important to immediately and thoroughly dry the murti of Srila Prabhupada with love and care, and to dry it as much as possible. You can place it in the sun after the abhisheka. The thing is, if moisture is left on the brass, it will darken in those areas. The murti is made of brass, so all the rules for caring for brass items apply to it."
